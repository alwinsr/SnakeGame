# Snake Game in Java
## Description
The Snake Game is a classic arcade game implemented in Java using the Swing library for the graphical interface. Players control the snake with keyboard inputs, guiding it to consume food and grow in length, while avoiding collisions with the walls or itself. This project demonstrates key Java programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and object-oriented design.
